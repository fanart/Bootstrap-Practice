# INSTRUCTIONS

This Project folder includes all the files you need to quickly get started.
Please use Bootstrap v3.6.6 and your knowledge of HTML5 and CSS3 best practices 
to code the landing page. 

## 1. View Design Comps in the Image Folder
You will find design comps for desktop, tablet and mobile in the "Comps"
folder located in the "images" folders. There is also an interaction video 
to call out the not so obvious subtlties in an image like hover 
interactions, rounded corners and borders. So be sure to check it out.  

## 2. Use the "helper.css" 
This file provides you with the neccessary external stylesheets and updated 
classes needed to code the landing page. Be sure to take a look before you start 
to code. DO NOT EDIT OR REMOVE this file.  

## 3. Edit the index.html
The index.html is your starter HTML doc. Add your page layout here. 

## 3. Create a Stylesheet
For styles not included in the helper.css, create a separate stylesheet. How 
you create it and where you locate it in the project folder is up to you.

## 4. Deliver the Project Completed
Once you have completed the assignment, send back the project folder with 
your updates.
